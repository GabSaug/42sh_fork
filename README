* How to use 42sh
42sh is a duplicate of the shell.
You can launch it in 3 modes : Interactive, Command, and File

To launch in Interactive mode, type:
./42sh
It will prompt for a command and execute it until you type 'exit'

To launch in Command mode, type :
./42sh -c Your_Command
It execute the You_Command and exit

To launch a script, type :
./42sh Your_File
It will execute Your_File and exit

You can also specify option :
  --ast-print : print the abstract syntax tree generated by the parser
  [-+]O : -O sets the value of the option and +O unset it
  --norc : desactivate the ressource header
  --version : print the current version of 42sh

The input string is first broken into tokens by the lexer and stored in a
vector. This vector is send to the parser which created an AST based on the
shell grammar. If there isn't any syntax error, the AST is executed, and the
returned value stored in $?.
All variable are stored in a hash table for a quick access.

42sh use the readline library. Thus you can use the up and down to use history.
